# Discord Security Moderation Bot

A powerful Discord moderation bot that provides comprehensive message logging and file security scanning to protect your server from malicious content.

## 🔒 Features

### Message Logging
- Logs all user messages with timestamps
- Tracks message content, user information, and channels
- Stores logs in a dedicated Discord channel

### File Security Scanning
- **Automatic file downloads** for analysis
- **File type detection** using MIME type verification
- **Extension validation** to detect disguised executables
- **SHA-256 hashing** for file fingerprinting
- **Size limit enforcement** (default 50MB)
- **Suspicious file alerts** with @here notifications

### Security Detection
- Identifies potentially dangerous file extensions (`.exe`, `.bat`, `.cmd`, `.scr`, `.vbs`, etc.)
- Detects MIME type mismatches (e.g., `.jpg` files that are actually executables)
- Real-time alerts for suspicious uploads
- Preserves uploaded files for forensic analysis

### Admin Commands
- `!setlog #channel` - Set the logging channel
- `!checkuser @user` - View user statistics and information

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Discord Bot Token with proper intents enabled

   - Go to the "Bot" section and create a bot
   - Enable **Message Content Intent** under Privileged Gateway Intents
   - Copy your bot token

4. **Configure the bot**
   - Open `mod_bot.py`
   - Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` with your bot token
   - Replace `LOG_CHANNEL_ID` with your logging channel ID

5. **Invite the bot to your server**

   - Select scopes: `bot`
   - Select permissions: `Read Messages`, `Send Messages`, `Embed Links`, `Attach Files`, `Read Message History`, `Mention Everyone`
   - Use the generated URL to invite the bot

## 💻 Usage

1. **Start the bot**
```bash
python mod_bot.py
```

2. **Set up logging channel**
```
!setlog #your-log-channel
```

3. **The bot will automatically:**
   - Log all messages to the designated channel
   - Scan file uploads for security threats
   - Alert moderators of suspicious activity

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can customize these settings in `mod_bot.py`:

```python
LOG_CHANNEL_ID = 123456789  # Your log channel ID
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 50 * 1024 * 1024  # Maximum file size (50MB)
SUSPICIOUS_EXTENSIONS = ['.exe', '.bat', '.cmd', '.scr', '.vbs', '.js', '.jar', '.app']
SCAN_DIR = './scanned_files'  # Directory for storing scanned files
```

## 📁 Project Structure

└── scanned_files/     # Folder for downloaded files (created automatically)
```

## 🛡️ Security Features Explained

### File Type Verification
The bot uses `python-magic` to detect the true file type, preventing attackers from disguising malicious files with fake extensions.

### Hash Fingerprinting
SHA-256 hashes allow you to identify known malicious files and track file distributions across your server.

### Persistent Storage
All scanned files are saved locally for evidence and further analysis if needed.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- The bot requires **Message Content Intent** to be enabled in the Discord Developer Portal
- Scanned files are stored in `./scanned_files/` - manage disk space accordingly
- This bot logs ALL messages - ensure compliance with your server's privacy policy
- Administrator permissions are required for setup commands
